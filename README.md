# Covid-19 in SP Brazil
### Google Chrome Extension

This is a Google Chrome extension that shows the latest data about Covid-19 in Sao Paulo state, Brazil.

It is very simple, and my purposes were:

- fetch data from a public API;
- practice working with dates;
- learn how to use a regular expression to format number in Brazilian format;
- learn how to create a `manifest.json` file to create a Google Chrome extension.

## Runtime Environment

- Google Chrome web browser.

## Adopted technologies

- HTML5;
- CSS3;
- JavaScript.

## Main difficulties

It was hard to write the regular expression to format numbers. It is something I need to study more, and go deeper.
